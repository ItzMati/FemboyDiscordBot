# Femboy Bot
A funky discord bot with a couple commands mostly focused around femboys.

To make the /send_image command work you should make and images folder and put folders with numbers from 1 to however many you want as the title of them in there. The bot chooses a random folder, and then sends a random image from in there. I did this to catogerize the images/videos but you can just make a folder called 1 and put everything in there.

The /send_boys folder needs a folder called bimages with a folder called boys and then the boy images in there. why i did it like this i dont know

also create a scores folder though it might make it for you.
