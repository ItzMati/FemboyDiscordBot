# Femboy Bot
A funky discord bot with a couple commands and a game were you guess if the image sent is a femboy of woman.

To make the /send_image command work you must add your own images folder. In that folder you should make folders from 1-however many you want. In the folders with numbers as titles you should put in the images. The bot will choose a random folder and then a random image from the folder. If you only have one folder named 1 then it will only chose from there.

Also create a scores folder though it might make it for you.

It has 9 commands
